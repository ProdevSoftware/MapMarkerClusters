# MapMarkerClusters

## iOS Google Map Custom Markers & Marker Clusters  

This repository contains a code demo showcasing how to implement custom markers and marker clusters on Google Maps in an iOS application.

## Overview

Integrating Google Maps into an iOS app is a powerful way to provide location-based features. However, customizing markers and managing clusters efficiently can enhance the user experience and improve the visual representation of location data.  

In this demo, we demonstrate:  

- Customizing marker icons to represent various points of interest or categories.
- Grouping nearby markers into clusters to improve map readability.
- Handling user interactions with custom markers, such as tapping for additional information.
- Smooth integration of Google Maps SDK with Swift codebase.

## Features

- **Custom Markers**: Create visually appealing markers tailored to your app's design and branding.
- **Marker Clusters**: Dynamically group nearby markers into clusters for better visualization of dense locations.
- **Interactive**: Allow users to interact with markers for more information or to trigger specific actions.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple integration into existing iOS projects using Swift.

## Getting Started

To get started with the demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ProdevSoftware/MapMarkerClusters.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Ensure you have a valid Google Maps API key.
4. Replace the placeholder API key with your own in the project configuration.
5. Build and run the project on a simulator or real device.

## Requirements

- Xcode 12 or later
- iOS 11.0+
- Google Maps API key

## Usage

The demo provides a basic example of how to implement custom markers and marker clusters. You can extend and customize the functionality to fit your specific requirements.
